Hi, my name is <b>Rodrigo Panachi</b>. I’ve been passionate about coding since the early 2000s. After earning my degree as a <b>Computer Scientist</b>, I turned that passion into a career, and I’ve been working as a [software engineer](/category/software-engineering) for the last two decades.

[I've been writing software for the last 25 years. Here some things I learned so far]({% post_url 2024-08-01-after-25-years-writing-software-here-some-things-learned-so-far %})

I’m all about <b>keeping things simple</b> and solving problems in the most efficient way possible. I’ve worked across a bunch of different industries: payments, e-commerce, health, logistics, education, you name it. This has given me a wide-ranging perspective and a solid foundation in various tech environments.

I’ve dabbled in a lot of programming languages along the way, like <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>Go</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>Elixir</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, whatever gets the job done. I’m all about building software that works well and meets real needs.

When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me tinkering with electronics, diving into <b>DIY projects</b>, or automating my home. I love experimenting with the <b>Arduino/ESP32</b>, artificial intelligence, and [3D printing]({{site.links.printables}}). It’s a fun way to keep learning and stay curious.

You can find my codes and the projects that I've contributed on <b>[Github]({{site.links.github}})</b>. Subscribe to my <b>[RSS feed]({{site.links.feed}})</b> to stay tuned on my next posts. You can also hire me on <b>[Linkedin]({{site.links.linkedin}})</b> :)
