Hi, my name is <b>Rodrigo Panachi</b>. I'm graduated as <b>Computer Scientist</b> and working as <b>Software Developer/Engineer</b> since 2002.

My primary language of choice is <b>Ruby</b>, but I also have experience with <b>Elixir</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b> and <b>Javascript</b>. Currently learning Go, Lua, Clojure and forever C.

On the spare times, I like to code and learn new things about technology and nerd/geek/hacking stuff like electronics and artificial intelligence.

Sometimes I gather some ideas and experiences and write a post on this site.

You can find my codes and the projects that I've contributed on <b>[Github]({{site.links.github}})</b>. Follow my thoughts on <b>[Twitter]({{site.links.twitter}})</b> and subscribe to my <b>[RSS feed]({{site.links.feed}})</b> to stay tuned on my next posts. You can also hire me on <b>[Linkedin]({{site.links.linkedin}})</b> :)
